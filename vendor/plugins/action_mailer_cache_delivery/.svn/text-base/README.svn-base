ActionMailerCacheDelivery
========================

Currently ActionMailer only supports :test, :smtp & :sendmail delivery methods.
This plugin enhances ActionMailer to support the :cache method, which behaves like
:test, except that the deliveries are marshalled to a temporary cache file, thus,
making them available to other processes.

Installation
============

  #$ cd RAILS_ROOT
  #$ ./script/plugin install git://github.com/ngty/action_mailer_cache_delivery.git

Example
=======

In your RAILS_ROOT/config/environments/test.rb, make sure you have the line:

  config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :cache

And that's all. To access the cached deliveries in another process, just do:

  ActionMailer::Base.cached_deliveries # array of TMail::Mail instances


Credits
